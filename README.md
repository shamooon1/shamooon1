# Hi there, I'm Shamoon

### Full-Stack Developer | AI Orchestration Enthusiast

I am a final-year Computer Science student and software developer passionate about building robust, scalable applications and intelligent autonomous systems. My experience spans across full-stack web development using the **MERN stack**, with a growing focus on backend engineering and **Agentic AI**. 

I enjoy bridging the gap between traditional software architecture and modern AI capabilities—moving beyond simple API calls to design multi-agent workflows, self-correcting AI loops, and dynamic tool discovery.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 **Full-Stack Foundation:** Experienced in building full-stack applications with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. I also focus heavily on writing optimal DSA logic rather than relying on brute-force solutions.
- 🤖 **Agentic AI Focus:** Deeply interested in AI orchestration. I actively work with **LangGraph** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to build Supervisor-Worker architectures and automate complex developer workflows.
- ⚙️ **Backend Evolution:** Currently expanding my backend expertise by transitioning into **Spring Boot (Java)** to build stronger, more structurally sound software architectures.
- 🛠️ **Professional Experience:** Previously interned as a developer where I architected MongoDB schemas and integrated advanced LLM APIs into web applications.
- 🎓 **Currently Building:** A Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform for my CS final year project, focusing on technical feasibility, seamless agent collaboration, and dynamic tool usage.

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python  
**Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend & Databases:** Node.js, Express.js, Spring Boot, MongoDB  
**AI & Orchestration:** LangGraph, Model Context Protocol (MCP), LLM API Integration (Gemini, etc.)  
**Tools & Architecture:** Git, RESTful APIs, System Design, Supervisor-Worker Patterns
